00 - AWS Account Setup (Lab Instructor Only)
==============

- Use a sandbox/lab account for this lab.  Onica users can use thier sso lab account.
- Login to AWS account with an IAM user with admin permissions
- Navigate to Cloud9 in N. Virginia/us-east 1 region: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-east-1
- Create a cloud9 environment called 'admin', accept all other defaults
- When the cloud9 environment is ready, open the cloud9 console in your browser
- In your cloud9 environment, do::

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/nbdev/serverless-workshop.git
    cd serverless-workshop
    git checkout cloud9-setup
    ./setup.sh

- When ``setup.sh`` is finished, run the following::

    git reset --hard
    git checkout step-1
    cd serverless
    npm install

- When ``npm install`` is complete, run the following replacing ``company_name`` with the name of the customer for whom we are doing the lab, or another name appropriate for the lab event::

    npm run setStage company_name

- Finally, run the following::

    git reset --hard
    git checkout step-10
    npm start

- Observe the console log output of stack deployment progress.  When the stack deployment completes, **take note** of the API-Gateway ServiceEndpoint value similar to the one below. You can also get this value later from the API-Gatway console::

    ServiceEndpoint: https://o2ykzz9u73.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/company_name

- In the AWS IoT console in region us-east-1 https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/dashboard:
    - Create a new certificate, use "One-click certificate creation (recommended)" 
    - **download** the cert (GUID.cert.pem) and private key (GUID.private.key)
    - activate the certificate
    - attach a suitable IAM policy

- IN the AWS IoT Console, choose **Settings** and note the IoT Endpoint Value, similar to::

    1234abcd5678-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

- Have the following items gathered in previous steps, prepared to share with the lab attendees:
    - The AWS API-Gateway ``ServiceEndpoint`` value
    - The AWS IoT Core ``Endpoint`` value
    - The certificate file (GUID.cert.pem)
    - The private key file (GUID.private.key)
    - SSID, username, and password for a wifi network provided by the facility hosting the lab.  This network must not require the use any web interface during the login process, just simple u/p auth.  If such a network is not available, bring a wifi hotspot.  The lab activities cannot be completed using a network that requires web auth. 

- When the lab is finished, tear down::

    # back in your Cloud9 environment
    node_modules/.bin/sls remove --stage=company_name
